# PRO-Pal: Productivity/Procrastination Buddy!

According to researchers, one of the causes of procrastination is that your brain values long-term benefits when they are in the future (tomorrow), but it values immediate gratification when it comes to the present moment (today). One of the ways to counteract this tendency is to make the consequences of procrastination more immediate.

PRO-Pal is a to-do list app that helps you to get a hold of your procrastination by adding consequences to your actions. Your PRO-pal starts with nine lives. Whenever you add a task to your to-do list, you are required to insert a time by which you expect to be done with your task. Complete this task later than your goal time, and your pal loses a life!

This incentivizes you to break tasks up into smaller, easier-to-accomplish subtasks so that it’s easier to not lose lives. This also makes consequences of procrastination more immediate (unless you’re cold-hearted and don’t care about cats, but then you’ve got other issues this app can’t help you with).

## Developer Roadmap

Here are some things that we would be interested in implementing later on down the road:

*Track high scores for how long you can go before procrastinating
*Set more dynamic rewards/consequences for procrastination (doing tasks earlier regenerates lives, being late by more than a few days loses more than one life, etc)
*Make the PRO-PAL more Tamagotchi-like (feeding, playing, petting, etc)
*Social aspect to app (compare streaks with friends, have PRO-PALs playing with each other)


This app was built by Peter, Dan, Shane, and Divya. It is our second group project for the UCSD Full Stack Development Bootcamp. It is a full stack app which follows the Model View Controller Framework and uses MySQL/Sequelize, Express.js, Express-Handlebars, and Node.js. It also uses an external library called Tempus Dominus which is a Bootstrap stylized datepicker. This app showcases our combined knowledge of integrating front and back end technologies, concepts, and frameworks.
